# 🌸 Iris Flower Species Classification using Random Forest 🌳

## 📋 Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements.  
We use a **Random Forest classifier** in Python with libraries like scikit-learn and pandas.

## 📊 Dataset
- The **Iris dataset** is a classic for ML beginners.  
- Contains 150 samples from 3 species:  
  🌼 *Setosa*  
  🌸 *Versicolor*  
  🌺 *Virginica*  
- Each sample has 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width.

## 🗂️ Files
- `IRIS.csv`: Dataset file with flower info and species labels.  
- `Untitled.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the full analysis — loading data, training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo or download all files.  
2. Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed.  
3. Install dependencies:  


4. Open `Untitled.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code notebook.  
5. Run all cells sequentially to see the results.

## 🔑 Key Concepts Covered
- Loading CSV with pandas 📥  
- Data preprocessing and train-test split 🔄  
- Training a Random Forest classifier 🌲  
- Evaluating with accuracy and confusion matrix 🎯  
- Visualizing model performance 📈

## 🧩 Confusion Matrix Explained
Shows correct and incorrect predictions per species. Easy to spot where the model confuses between flower types.
